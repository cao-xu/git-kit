**Git-Kit** is a collection of powerful, interactive shell scripts designed to automate the most common (and often tedious) tasks in a developer's daily Git workflow. From syncing branches to creating perfectly formatted merge requests, Git-Kit makes you faster, more consistent, and less prone to error.

This toolkit was born from real-world development pain points and is built for maximum efficiency and team collaboration.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **`git-sync`**: Interactively syncs your feature branch with the main branch (`develop` or `main`), including a robust, guided conflict resolution process.
- **`gitmr`**: Creates a Merge/Pull Request from your current branch to a chosen target. It automatically copies the task URL to your clipboard and opens the MR page in your browser.
- **`gitmr-release`**: A specialized, safety-focused tool for creating release MRs (e.g., `develop` -> `master`), with mandatory branch updates and guided CI status checks.

| **ü§ù Teamwork** | Inconsistent | **Standardized** | **Better Collaboration** |

## üèÅ Quick Start

### 1. Requirements
- `bash` (v3.2+), standard on macOS and most Linux distributions.
- For Windows, use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), which comes with Git for Windows.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to a permanent location on your local machine (e.g., `~/tools` or `~/dev`).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/git-kit.git ~/git-kit
```

### 3. Run the Installer
The installer copies the scripts to `/usr/local/bin` to make them available system-wide.
```bash
# You may be asked for your password
sudo ~/git-kit/install.sh
```
> **Note:** The installer also creates a template configuration file at `~/.git-kit-config.template`.

### 4. Configure for Your Projects
For each of your projects where you want to use Git-Kit, copy the template and customize it.
```bash
# Navigate to your project's directory
cd /path/to/your-project

# Copy the global template to your project's root
cp ~/.git-kit-config.template ./.git-kit-config
```
Now, open `./.git-kit-config` and edit the values to match your project's setup (e.g., project IDs, branch names, repo paths). See the [Configuration](#-configuration) section for more details.

### 5. You're Ready!
Navigate to your project's directory and start using the commands.
```bash
# In your project's directory
git-sync

# Create a feature branch MR
gitmr

# Create a release MR
gitmr-release
```

## üîß Configuration

The `.git-kit-config` file is a simple INI-style file that centralizes all your settings. The scripts look for this file in the current repository's root first, then fall back to your home directory (`~/.git-kit-config`) for global settings.

A typical configuration looks like this:
```ini
# .git-kit-config

# [General Settings]
# Used by gitmr and gitmr-release for the MR description
task_management_url = "https://your-org.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123"

# [Release Settings]
# Used by gitmr-release
release_target_branch = "master"
release_source_branch = "develop"

# [Project Definitions]
# Used by gitmr and gitmr-release to generate correct MR links.
# Format: Nickname = "ProjectID,RepoPath"
# RepoPath should match the path part of your git remote URL (e.g., group/project-name)
projects = (
  "My-API-Server" = "12345,my-group/my-api-server"
  "My-Frontend"   = "67890,my-group/my-frontend-app"
)

# [Target Branches for gitmr]
# A list of common branches you can select when creating a feature MR.
target_branches = (
    "develop"
    "main"
    "master"
    "test"
)
```
